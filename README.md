# Doan
Doan is a simple platformer game where you need to get to the door while dodging enemies and collecting coins (totally doesn't sound like another famous platformer)

# Why you should play this game
 - There is for now  (20)  levels with increasing difficulty in the main quest
 - Once you finished the game, you can access all the different minigames such as Subway Surfing, Crossing Road, Plaffy Bird and Geometrical Dash
 - You can create and play your own levels using the very intuitive level editor
 - If you collect enough coins, you can buy some skins in the shop (my favourite being Steven from Minecarft for 999 coins)
 - ALL the textures were made by hand by myself even tho I draw like a 4yo kid so you need to check them out

# Explaination of every folder's utility
 - DATA: saves the data so that if you buy a skin, complet a level etc..., it will be saved if you close the game
 - DOAN en EXE: This folder contains the game using an exe file so you don't need to have a code editor to play the game
 - FONTS, IMAGES, SOUNDS, SPRITES, LEVELS: pretty obvious isn't it?
